# Gender and Age Detection using TensorFlow and Computer Vision

## Introduction
This notebook script demonstrates the process of building a gender and age detection system using TensorFlow and computer vision techniques. The system analyzes facial images to predict the gender and age of individuals. It involves collecting and preprocessing a diverse dataset of facial images, training and optimizing deep learning models for gender and age classification, and integrating the models for usage within the designated environment.

## Features
- Detects gender (male/female) and age (in predefined categories) from facial images.
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
- Implements data augmentation for robust model training.
- Provides a flexible and scalable solution for gender and age prediction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
3. Prepare the dataset:
- Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of facial images.
- Organize the dataset into appropriate directories (e.g., separate directories for training and testing images).
4. Train the models:
- Use the provided scripts to train the gender and age detection models.
- Fine-tune the models as necessary to achieve desired performance.
5. Evaluate the models:
- Evaluate the trained models on a separate test dataset to assess their performance.
6. Integrate the models:
- Integrate the trained models into your application or environment for real-time gender and age detection.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers for regularization, flatten layer, and dense (fully connected) layers for age and gender prediction.

## Training Process
The training process involves data augmentation, model compilation, and fitting the model using the training dataset. The model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance and fine-tuned as necessary.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as loss and accuracy on both the training and validation datasets.
